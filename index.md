# Paritosh Sharma - Computer Graphics Research  [CV](./CV.pdf)


## About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Biovision, INRIA Sophia Antipolis](https://team.inria.fr/biovision/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, working on deep generative approaches for personalized training in virtual reality. I received my Ph.D. from [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, during which I worked at [Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire des Sciences du Numérique](https://www.lisn.upsaclay.fr){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, under the supervision of [Michael Filhol](https://www.lisn.upsaclay.fr/membres/filhol-michael/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on animating Sign Language descriptions using 3D avatars, combining linguistic modeling, computer graphics, and animation techniques to enhance the naturalness and scalability of the synthesis. I received my Master of Science in Informatics from [Université Grenoble Alpes](https://mosig.imag.fr){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, specializing in computer graphics and machine learning. I received my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from [SRM Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.srmist.edu.in){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, where I developed a strong foundation in programming and algorithms.

## Research

My research interests focus on leveraging Computer Graphics and Human-Computer Interaction to enhance accessibility.

### VR for low-vision rehabilitation and diagnosis
Currently, I am working on deep generative approaches for the personalized creation of content aimed at low-vision rehabilitation and diagnosis as part of the [Creative3D project](https://project.inria.fr/creattive3d/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

### Synthesis for AZee expressions
During my PhD, I [worked](https://phd.paritosh-sharma.com/) on animating AZee(a sign language description language) expressions using avatars.

### Interaction methods for eye tracking for cognitively disabled people
During my M1 thesis, my work aimed at improving the eye interaction methods for [GazePlay](https://gazeplay.github.io/GazePlay/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
