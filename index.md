# Paritosh Sharma - Computer Graphics Research  [CV](./CV.pdf)


## About Me

I am a PhD student at [Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire des Sciences du Numérique](https://www.lisn.upsaclay.fr){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} working under [Michael Filhol](https://www.lisn.upsaclay.fr/membres/filhol-michael/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in team [LIPS](https://www.lisn.upsaclay.fr/research/research-departments/sciences-and-language-technologies/lips/?lang=en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 
I received my Bachelor of Technology at [SRM Institude of Science and Technology](https://www.srmist.edu.in){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and then my Master of Science at [Université Grenoble Alpes](https://mosig.imag.fr){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
My Ph.D. work focuses on animating sign language descriptions using 3D Avatars.

## Research

My research interests have been in the fields of Computer Graphics, Robotics and Human-Computer Interaction.

### Synthesis for AZee expressions
Currently, I [work](https://phd.paritosh-sharma.com/) on animating AZee(a sign language description language) expressions using avatars.

### Interaction methods for eye tracking for cognitively disabled people
During my M1 thesis, my work aimed at improving the eye interaction methods for [GazePlay](https://gazeplay.github.io/GazePlay/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
